# Stages for changes to the GraphQL Specification

> **Document status:** [Draft](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/pull/342)

This document describes the stages required for merging changes to the
GraphQL Specification. These stages are intended to:

+ Be as flexible as possible.
+ Define a clear process for getting changes into the specification.
+ Provide visibility for participants in the GraphQL ecosystem into the
status and progress of proposals.
+ Encourage community discussion around the proposed changes.

Any changes to the specification that affect the behavior of **GraphQL server
or client implementations** should go through the stages below no matter how
small they are. All other changes should be labeled as “editorial” and may
be merged right away.

## Stage -2: proposed change (optional)

**Prerequisite**: Described problem/change should be specific to the content of
GraphQL Specification and not be an implementation detail.

**Purpose**: Filter out questions and issues for other repos, and engage community
discussion.

## Stage -1: PR requested (optional)

**Prerequisite**: Issue should contain description of problem or use case and
proposed solution.

**Purpose**: Find member of community to be champion for this change.
